Week 2
======

The aim of Week 2 is to introduce working with the command line, and then starting to work in Python. Many programming tasks make use of the command line, and so it's important to have some familiarity with it before we get to the main body of the course on Python. We'll also start using version control software to help manage our code.

It is the command line part of the course that varies the most depending on which operating system your using (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Make sure you follow the correct instructions for the operating system that you're using.
