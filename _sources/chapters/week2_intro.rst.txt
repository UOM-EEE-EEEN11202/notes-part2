Week 2
======

The aim of Week 2 is to introduce working with the command line, and to introduce working with version control software. Although the core aim of this part of the course is to focus on Python programming, we won't actually get to that until next week! This does give the course a relatively slow start. This is deliberate - for writing code that can integrate into larger projects we first need to learn about some of the aspects that go around writing Python code, before just launching in. These topics are really important, so don't be tempted to skip over them to get to the Python part. 

Also, we know that some people taking the course will have studied Python or other programming languages, to some greater or lesser extent, previously; whereas others will essentially be starting from scratch. A gentle ramp-up gives us the opportunity to make sure everyone is on the same page.

It is this part of the course that varies the most depending on which operating system your using (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Make sure you follow the correct instructions for the operating system that you're using.
