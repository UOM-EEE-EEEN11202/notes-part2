Introduction
============

Welcome to Part 2 of the EEEN11202 lecture notes. This part focuses on general purpose computing, mainly with Python. 

The content is arranged into *Weeks* following the `unit delivery plan <https://uom-eee-eeen11202.github.io/chapters/course_administration/unit_delivery_plan.html>`_. This is to help guide you through the course. You can of course work at your own pace, faster or slower than this recommended rate if you would like. EEEN11202 is a 12 week course in total, and this part of the notes covers Weeks 1 to Week 6. 

Each *week* in the notes contains the learning materials for that week - generally a mixture of theory for that particular topic, some lab assignments, some marked formative assessments where we ask you to upload code so you can receive feedback, and some formative feedback quizzes where you can test your knowledge before moving on. You should complement these activities with your reading of `Part 0 <https://uom-eee-eeen11202.github.io/>`_ and `Part 1 <https://uom-eee-eeen11202.github.io/notes-part1/>`_ of the notes, which give a more general overview of the different topics, and your `wider reading <https://uom-eee-eeen11202.github.io/chapters/course_administration/suggested_reading.html>`_ to enable you to go into more depth.
