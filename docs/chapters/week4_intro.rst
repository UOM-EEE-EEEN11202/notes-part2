Week 4
======
The aim of Week 4 is to introduce some common external Python libraries which are widely used in Electronic Engineering. There are many thousands of external libraries available for Python, and we won't cover them all! We'll focus on a few key libraries which are widely used. This will help build some familiarity and move us towards more real-world applications of Python.
