Git branches
============
We learnt about version control using Git :ref:`back in Lab A <lab_a_stage_2>`. Since then, you've been using Git to submit your assignments, and you've been regularly checking in your working code as you go along (you have haven't you?), but we've not said much more about version control. There are lots of features and functions. We're going to look at one of these here, known as *branches*.

In one repository, we can have multiple copies of the same code. These are known as branches. Each branch is version controlled separately and can be worked on separately. The default branch is usually called :console:`main`. VSCode will likely be displaying that you're working on the :console:`main` branch.

Working directly in the :console:`main` branch is fine for small projects. However, it doesn't give a space for experimentation. Essentially, the code in main is your end product. Every time you update this, you're updating the final version. If you're fixing a bug, or adding a new feature, it can be beneficial to make a dedicated branch for this work. You can then get the code working in this branch, and only update main once everything is working. This can help compartmentalize development, and avoid breaking the main code during day-to-day working.

Making a new branch
-------------------
#. In your Lab H workspace, make a new branch called :console:`dev`:

   .. tab-set::
      :sync-group: gui_cli

      .. tab-item:: :fa:`tv` GUI
         :sync: key4

         Click on :console:`main` in the bottom left of the VSCode window and then :console:`+ Create new branch`

         Type in :console:`dev` as the branch name and press enter.

         .. figure:: ./images/vscode_make_branch2.png
            :width: 800

         VSCode will automatically switch to the new branch once it's created.

      .. tab-item:: :fa:`terminal` CLI
         :sync: key5

         .. code-block:: console

            git branch dev
            git checkout dev

         The :console:`git branch dev` command makes a new branch, based upon the current branch. The :console:`git checkout dev` command switches the branch. Remember that you can use :console:`git status` to check which branch you're on.
   
   
   You should see the branch name change to :console:`dev` in the bottom left of the VSCode window.

Using and switching branches
----------------------------

#. In your Lab H :console:`src` folder make a new file called :console:`branches.py`. You can put some code into it, or it can be empty for now. 

   As you're working in the :console:`dev` branch, this file exists in the current branch, :console:`dev`, as shown in the view below. (You might need to press the :console:`Refresh` button for the display of files to be updated.)

   .. figure:: ./images/file_in_dev.png
      :width: 800
      :align: center
      :alt: VSCode window showing a file in the dev branch

      Screenshot of VSCode, software from `Microsoft <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`_. See `course copyright statement <https://uom-eee-eeen11202.github.io/chapters/about/copyright>`_.


   Check this new file into Git:

   .. tab-set::
      :sync-group: gui_cli

      .. tab-item:: :fa:`tv` GUI
         :sync: key4

         On the :console:`Source Control` tab, you should see :console:`branches.py` listed as a new file. Hover over it and click the :console:`+` icon to add it to be tracked. Then enter a commit message in the box at the top and click the :console:`✓ Commit` icon to commit it.

         .. figure:: ./images/vscode_git_commit.png
            :width: 800

            Screenshot of VSCode, software from `Microsoft <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`_. See `course copyright statement <https://uom-eee-eeen11202.github.io/chapters/about/copyright>`_.


      .. tab-item:: :fa:`terminal` CLI
         :sync: key5

         Assuming your terminal is in the :console:`lab-h` folder (not :console:`lab-h/src`) run

         .. code-block:: console

            git add src/branches.py
            git commit -a -m "Added branches.py in dev branch"


#. Switch back to the main branch:

   .. tab-set::
      :sync-group: gui_cli

      .. tab-item:: :fa:`tv` GUI
         :sync: key4

         Click on :console:`dev` in the bottom left of the VSCode window and then click on the :console:`main` branch (i.e. the branch you want to switch to). 

         .. figure:: ./images/vscode_switch_branch.png
            :width: 800
            :align: center
            :alt: Switching branches in VSCode

            Screenshot of VSCode, software from `Microsoft <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`_. See `course copyright statement <https://uom-eee-eeen11202.github.io/chapters/about/copyright>`_.

      .. tab-item:: :fa:`terminal` CLI
         :sync: key5

         .. code-block:: console

            git checkout main

   You'll see that the file :console:`branches.py` is no longer present in the file explorer. This is because it only exists in the :console:`dev` branch. (Again you might need to press the :console:`Refresh` button for the display of files to be updated.)

   .. figure:: ./images/file_in_main.png
      :width: 800
      :align: center
      :alt: VSCode window showing the file is not present in the main branch

      Screenshot of VSCode, software from `Microsoft <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`_. See `course copyright statement <https://uom-eee-eeen11202.github.io/chapters/about/copyright>`_.


   You can see how this lets us work on code in the :console:`dev` branch without affecting the code in the :console:`main` branch.

#. Follow the steps above again to switch back to the :console:`dev` branch. You should see that :console:`branches.py` is back again.

#. In your Lab H :console:`src` folder you will find a file called :console:`practice.py`. When run, it displays :console:`Hello from lab-h!` to the screen.

   Make sure you're in the :console:`dev` branch, and then add some additional code to this file. For example, change the message that is displayed to the screen. You could make it:

   .. code-block:: python

      def main():
          print("Hello from lab-h!")
          print("Hello from branch dev!")


      if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()

   Check your changes in to Git. (Follow the instructions above if you're not sure how to do this.)

   Switch back to the main branch (again following the instructions above) and you should see that the same file in the two different branches contains different code. The figure below show the same file in the two different branches.

Merging branches
----------------
#. When you're ready, you can *merge* branches together to combine the code. 

   .. tab-set::
      :sync-group: gui_cli

      .. tab-item:: :fa:`tv` GUI
         :sync: key4

         Make sure you are in branch :console:`main`. Then, on the :console:`Source Control` tab, click on the three dots :console:`...` at the top right to open the menu. Select :console:`Branch / Merge ...`.

         .. figure:: ./images/vscode_merge1.png
            :width: 800
            :align: center
            :alt: Switching branches in VSCode

            Screenshot of VSCode, software from `Microsoft <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`_. See `course copyright statement <https://uom-eee-eeen11202.github.io/chapters/about/copyright>`_.


         Select the branch that you want to merge into :console:`main`. We only have one other branch, :console:`dev`, in our example. 

         .. figure:: ./images/vscode_merge2.png
            :width: 800
            :align: center
            :alt: Switching branches in VSCode

            Screenshot of VSCode, software from `Microsoft <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`_. See `course copyright statement <https://uom-eee-eeen11202.github.io/chapters/about/copyright>`_.


      .. tab-item:: :fa:`terminal` CLI
         :sync: key5

         .. code-block:: console

            git checkout main
            git merge dev

         This merges the changes from branch :console:`dev` into branch :console:`main`. 
   
   You should see that the code in the :console:`main` branch has now been updated to include the changes you made in the :console:`dev` branch.

   .. figure:: ./images/vscode_merged_branches.png
      :width: 800
      :align: center

#. The above was a nice simple example, we only changed a small bit of code. 

   When making larger changes you can have *conflicts* when you try to merge branches. These occur if the same code has been edited in two different ways in the two branches. Git won't automatically know which version to keep and so you have to *resolve* conflicts manually. We won't cover resolving conflicts here, but as you move on to more advanced version control this might be something you want to look in to.
