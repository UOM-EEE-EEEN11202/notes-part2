Lab D
=====
Lab D is all about testing in Python. We've made a number of Python scripts so far, and probably some of them haven't worked first time for you. You've had to search for your errors and fix the code to make it run. Both Python and VSCode have a wide number of built-in tools to help with this *debugging* and we'll explore some of these in the first part of the lab. 

In the second part of the lab we'll look at `unit testing <https://uom-eee-eeen11202.github.io/notes-part1/chapters/software_development_tools/automated_testing.html>`_. It's one thing to convince ourselves that our code is working. It's another to be able to convince your boss, or your customer, that our code is working. Unit tests will help us methodically test our code.
