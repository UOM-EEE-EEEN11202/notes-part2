Week 6
======
Week 6 is the last part of the course on Python. We're going to start off in :ref:`Lab I <lab_i>` by looking at AI in Python and AI in coding more generally. In :ref:`Lab J <lab_j>` we won't really introduce any new material, other than a few comments on what comes next if you want to go deeper into Python. Instead, there will be a longer assignment.
