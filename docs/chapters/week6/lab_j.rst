Lab J
=====
The good news (if you view it that way) is that there isn't really a Lab J. This is the end of the Python part of the course, and so we wanted to give people a bit of extra time to make sure they've caught up on everything, and to give a longer more open ended assignment.

We have just a few notes on *what comes next*, if you're going to keep going in Python, but there aren't really any tasks associated with this. The main work is straight onto the assignment.
