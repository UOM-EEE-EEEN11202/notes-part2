Week 5
======
In Week 5 we're going to look at two main topics: `objects <https://uom-eee-eeen11202.github.io/notes-part1/chapters/programming_fundamentals/objects.html>`_ and `error handling <https://uom-eee-eeen11202.github.io/notes-part1/chapters/programming_fundamentals/asserts_and_exceptions.html>`_. Each of these will be paired with a smaller topic (multi-file scripts and Git branches), as we move towards the end of the Python part of the course to make sure we've covered the key concepts that we want to cover.
