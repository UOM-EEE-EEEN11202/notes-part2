Lab A
=====

Welcome to the first lab! In this we are going to explore using the command line to interact with your computer.

In `Part 0 of the notes <https://uom-eee-eeen11202.github.io/>`_ we included instructions on `how to install a programming environment on your computer <https://uom-eee-eeen11202.github.io/chapters/useful_information/install.html>`_. You don't need to follow those instructions yet. (There's no harm if you've already done this. We're just going to use the tools that are built into your computer first.)

Each of the labs is broken down into three stages: two stages of *tutorial style* or *problem style* steps to work through; and one assignment to help you test your knowledge. From the `unit delivery plan <https://uom-eee-eeen11202.github.io/chapters/course_administration/unit_delivery_plan.html>`_ each lab is expected to take approximately three hours in total. If taking the course in person in Manchester, you have a two hour lab allocated where individual support will be available for asking questions. You're then expected to complete the lab tasks in your own time.
