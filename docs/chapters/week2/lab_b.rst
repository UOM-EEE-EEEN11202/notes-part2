Lab B
=====
In Lab B we're going to start using Python, and will work some more on version control as introduced in :ref:`Lab A <lab_a>`.

We'll focus on using Python in :ref:`Jupyter interactive mode <python_modes>` before moving on to :ref:`batch mode <python_modes>` in Lab X. 

Python is a very versatile language, there are lots of different ways of fundamentally doing the same thing. We're going to look at one particular way. If you've used similar, but different, approaches previously, VSCode as we introduce in this lab. 

The contents of Lab B are:
