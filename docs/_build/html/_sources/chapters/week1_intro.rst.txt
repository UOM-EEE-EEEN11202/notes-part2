Week 1
======

The aim of Week 1 is to give you time to become familiar with the course and how it will run. There is a large amount of information in `Part 0 <https://uom-eee-eeen11202.github.io/>`_ and `Part 1 <https://uom-eee-eeen11202.github.io/notes-part1/>`_ of the notes, and Week 1 gives you time to go over this. 

There are no labs or formative assessments. They start in Week 2. There is a feedback quiz so that you can test your knowledge before moving on to Week 2.
