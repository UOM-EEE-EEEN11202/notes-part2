   ## The diagram below, showing the parts of a computer system, is missing a central part. What is this part?

   1. [ ] The core
       > That's not correct. A core is part of a processor, but it's not a complete processor, and all computers need a processor.
   1. [ ] The soundcard
       > That's not correct. Most computers will have soundcards, allowing audio to be played, but they're not the central part of the computer drawn here.
   1. [ ] Touch input
       > That's not correct. Touch input is widely used in some computer systems, but it's not the central part of the computer drawn here.
   1. [x] The processor
       > That's correct!
   1. [ ] The cache
       > That's not correct. Cache is memory very local to the processor, typically on the same microchip. Cache is part of a processor, but it's not a complete processor, and all computers need a processor.


   ## Sustainability isn't an important factor in programming.
   
   1. [x] True
       > That's correct! When starting out, we tend to focus on making programs that are functionally correct - ones that do what we want. Once they are working, there are a wide range of other factors, such as security and sustainability we may need to take into account. 
   1. [ ] False
       > That's not correct. Computer systems use large amounts of energy and water, and inefficient coding can waste lots of resources.


   ## What is the name of the Integrated Development Environment that we'll use in this course?

   1. [x] VSCode
   1. [ ] Visual Studio
   1. [ ] Xcode
   1. [ ] Eclipse
   1. [ ] Code blocks


   ## What is the function of static code analysis in an integrated development environment?

   1. [ ] To analyze code after it has executed to detect errors that occurred.
   1. [ ] To analyze code while it is running to debug and detect errors.
   1. [x] To analyze code before it is compiled to pre-detect potential errors.
   1. [ ] To analyze our requirements and generate code for us using generative artificial intelligence.
   1. [ ] To carry out all tasks listed here.


   ## What is meant by a conditional break point? 

   1. [ ] A line of code that changes the flow of the program
   1. [x] A debugger setting that pauses the program execution in certain cases
   1. [ ] A comment that explains which code is relevant to different situations
   1. [ ] An assert statement that stops the execution of the program when triggered
   1. [ ] A setting used to control when the code is checked into a version control repository
